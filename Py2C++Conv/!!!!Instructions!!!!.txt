In order to run this project, please rename the .cpp file as source.cpp and then run convertor.py. It will upload the converted cpp code to result.py.
Its biggest limitation is that it cannot deal with the lack of brackets({}), so please make sure that any if, while, function etc has proper brackets. 
This project was made by Bazarea Eduard-Nicolae, Hristea Mircea, Macoveiciuc Teodor and Pop Fabius-Sever from FILS 1231B
